Deploying a Contract
********************

Once you are ready to deploy your contract to a public test net or the main net, you have several options:

* Take the bytecode generated by the vyper compiler and manually deploy it through mist or geth:

.. code-block:: bash

  vyper yourFileName.vy
  # returns bytecode

* Take the byte code and ABI and depoly it with your current browser on `myetherwallet's <https://www.myetherwallet.com/>`_ contract menu:

.. code-block:: bash

  vyper -f abi yourFileName.vy
  # returns ABI

* Use the remote compiler provided by the `Remix IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_ to compile and deploy your contract on your net of choice. Remix also provides a JavaScript VM to test deploy your contract.

.. note::
   While the vyper version of the Remix IDE compiler is updated on a regular basis it might be a bit behind the latest version found in the master branch of the repository. Make sure the byte code matches the output from your local compiler.
